README to be defined.

For now, please read [Globalize Webpack Plugin][] documentation. Usage is very
similar, but with one more attribute:

* `writeMessages`: writes new default messages for all supported locales
  under the `messages` filepath specified.

`writeMessages` requires `messages` to be set.

Also, see [react-globalize][] and [Globalize][].
